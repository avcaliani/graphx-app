# üçá GraphX App

Here are some PoCs I did to learn more about the GraphX API for Apache Spark.  
I did **two different exercises**, they are...

## Calculate the Distances

Our challenge here is to **calculate the sum of `distances (edges) * multipliers (vertex)` for each node in the tree**.

![basic-graph](.docs/basic-graph.png)

So, for example, the **expected** output for the **Node 4 (purple)** is 20 üëá

```bash
Node ID ‚Üí 4
Node Multiplier ‚Üí 1.0
Edges ‚Üí 12.0, 8.0

Expected Result = [12.0 * 1.0 + 8.0 * 1.0] = 20
```

## LoL Items

Our challenge here is to **calculate the total price** of each item in the graph.

![lol-graph](.docs/lol-graph.png)

**Business Rules**  
If the item rarity is "Basic" then the `total_cost` is the item `cost`.  
Otherwise, the `total_cost` is the **sum** of the preivious items `total_cost * amount`..
